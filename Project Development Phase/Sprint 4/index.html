                        <h1>What happens to your Google Account after your death? Here’s how you can keep your data safe</h1>
                        <p>Our lives are increasingly dependent on the digital world, and Google is perhaps the one service that all of us rely on. Whether it is for storing photos or important files or our personal emails, control over one’s Google account is very critical given the amount of data. But what happens to our Google account and all of its data when we pass away? Luckily, Google ensures that you can make preparations for the worst-case scenario so that a loved one say a family member or friend can gain access to your account and retrieve some of this data. Thankfully, Google’s Inactive Account Manager’ ensures that users can share parts of their data with trusted family members or friends. This comes into place after the account has been inactive for a while. Or one can choose to ensure that all of their data is deleted in entirety upon their death. Here’s how Google’s Inactive Account manager works and how to set it up.

                        <h1>Football World Cup: The Scottish secret behind Brazilian Jogo Bonito</h1>
                        <p>It’s said that one can really understand football only when looked through Brazil’s eyes. Not many know, though, that the Brazilian vision is Scottish in origin. Not just the introduction of the game and organising the early matches but the playing style itself. In fact, football, as we know it today, owes gurudakshina to Scotland for it was the Scottish who invented and introduced the ‘passing style’ in football. Arguably, it was England who found the game but their style was a spillover from Rugby in many ways; a scrummage of sorts, kick and run, long-balls, but an early proto-type of tiki-taka was Scottish’s influence. Pass the ball, the to-and-fro’s, the wing-game and so on and so forth.

                        <h1>Intel Hit With $949 Million Verdict in US Trial Over Violation of VLSI Computer Chip Patent</h1>
                        <p>A federal jury in Texas on Tuesday said Intel Corp must pay VLSI Technology LLC $948.8 million for infringing a VLSI patent for computer chips.

VLSI, a patent-holding company affiliated with the SoftBank Group-owned private equity firm Fortress Investment Group, argued during the six-day trial that Intel's Cascade Lake and Skylake microprocessors violated its patent covering improvements to data processing.

An Intel spokesperson said the company "strongly disagrees" with the verdict and plans to appeal, and that the case is "one example of many that shows the US patent system is in urgent need of reform."
